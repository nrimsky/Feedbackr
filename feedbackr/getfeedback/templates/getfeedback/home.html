<h1>Feedbackr</h1>
<br />
<ul>
    <li>Feedbackr is a super simple piece of software to help collect yes/no feedback on language model outputs from
        humans.</li>

    <li>Just upload your prompt/completion dataset as a JSON file and anyone will be able to score the completions via a
        generated link.</li>
    <li>You can download the collected data from the platform at any point.</li>
    <li>Please do not upload sensitive data, and remember that Feedbackr is still in development so may be completely
        reliable.</li>
</ul>
